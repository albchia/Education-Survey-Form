#### Project Overview

Title: _"Education Survey Form"_

> GitHub: [link](https://github.com/albchia/Education-Survey-Form.git)

This project has been inspired by survey forms. The task is to create the form and personalize it working on style and design.

#### Project Instructions

Feel free to customize questions, answers and style.
For inspiration, you can try playing around with `background-colors`, `border-radius`, `buttons`, `input types` and `option values`.
You can even add a `box-shadow` around the form, changing `font` and `size`.
